TESTS:

Tests are largely manual right now and consist of two basic things:

browsing directories with different types of filename formats and special charaters, links/aliases, at different sorts

browsing directories with an extremely large number of images from slow drives - and avoiding lag while doing so

# Permissions Justifications

 * rotation feature requiers captureVisibleTab from BG page, which unfrotunately requiers "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
   * if captureVisibleTab would work from here with file:///* permissions then that would be the restricted set I need
   * moving this feature to the popup would be awkward...
   * the other rotate work around I had going stopped working... this is reliable at least... if not annoying.

# Just pretending this works (manifest v3)

 * web_accessible_resources (reminder: file is not a web)
 * sharing files with module and content scripts
